  Hello everyone, my name is Benjamin and I study at Red River College Polytechnic and am enrolled in the BIT program. In this blog post, I want to share with you some of the wellness activities and dietary services that are available for students at RRC Polytech. These are some of the ways that I take care of my physical and mental health while studying on campus.</summary><br><br>


One of the wellness activities that I enjoy is Sports. RRC Polytech offers different varieties of sporting equipment at the Notre Dame Campus and few at the exchange distinct campus like the table tennis. playing sports helps me relax, stretch, and breathe better. It also releases stress and improves my concentration. You can find more details about RRC Sports here: <br>https://www.rrc.ca/well-being/sport/

Another wellness activity that I like is painting. RRC Polytech organizes monthly paint nights where you can unleash your creativity and have fun with other students and staff. The paint nights are virtual, so you can join from anywhere. You just need to get your own supplies and follow the instructions from the instructor. You can also show off your artwork and win prizes.

Having a proper diet when in school is important, it's easy for us to go through the day snacking on the vending machines, or ordering mnultiple times a day at Tim Hortons- because that is what is around our campus. One of the dietary services that I use is the cooking for wellness program. This is a virtual program where you can learn how to prepare healthy and delicious meals with simple ingredients. The program also teaches you about nutrition, food safety and budgeting.

# Mental Health Services

 ![image](https://theprojector.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23012018-THEPROJECTORPHOTO2-CORTES-1.jpg)

Hello, my name is Augustina, or Tina for short and I am here to speak to you about mental health, and what services we offer here at Red River College. Good mental health helps us live the life we want and contribute to a community, while reaching academic and career goals.  it's easy for students to become overwhelmed by the demands of coursework, social pressures, and the uncertainty of the future. Nurturing your mental health is crucial for not only academic success but also overall well-being. Here's a concise guide to help you navigate the often-challenging terrain of student life.

As students, we often shift our focus towards our assignments, deadlines and craft of our material. When we shift our focus onto these tasks, we often lose sight on something more important, self care. It's nice being on top of all your goals and aspirations, but what good is success if we're failing to take care of ourselves mentally. We often dont realize the effects on mental health has on us, until someone like a friend or relative addresses you with concern as they've noticed a shift on your behavior or awareness. Often times however, not everyone has the luxary of speaking with a friend or relative about what is weighing you down and thats where Red River College can assist.

### Counselling Services for Students: 
You should understand as students here at RRC, you are not alone. We are commited to providing excellent service and support to our students.

4. Prioritize Self-Care Make self-care a non-negotiable part of your routine. Ensure you get adequate sleep, eat nourishing meals, and engage in activities that bring you joy. Establishing a balance between academic responsibilities and personal well-being is fundamental to maintaining mental health.
5. Effective time management is key to reducing stress. Break down tasks into manageable chunks, prioritize assignments, and create a realistic schedule. Procrastination can amplify anxiety, so stay organized and tackle tasks gradually.
6. Failure is a natural part of any journey. Instead of viewing it negatively, see it as an opportunity for growth. Learn from your mistakes, adapt your strategies, and persevere. Resilience is a crucial skill that contributes to mental strength.
7. Strive for progress, not perfection. Acknowledge your achievements and growth, no matter how small. Embrace the learning process and understand that success is a journey, not a destination.


Remember, your mental health is a priority. By incorporating these strategies into your student life, you can foster a supportive environment that promotes well-being and success. Take proactive steps to care for your mental health, and you'll find yourself better equipped to navigate the challenges of student life.
